Easy way to retrieve market data for companies I invest in

User input of a any stock tickers they want to use. 
These are used to retrieve market data from a free marketwatch account.
This data is used to calculate day/week/month price performance and converted to a dataframe in Pandas.
The data is trimmed to my liking and displayed in a convenient way
